## ✨ Features at a Glance

Focused on microfeatures and safer alternatives to Discord's dangerous permissions, Mini-Tool delivers powerful tools that give users and staff more control—without overreaching permissions or complexity. This can help solve potential moderation issues revolving around nuking or spamming of roles, channels, or messages.

### 🃏 Card
A flexible prefix/suffix title system for roles.  
Let users personalize their display names with custom titles, managed through roles.

### 🧵 Fabric & 👗 Wardrobe
Advanced role manipulation for staff:

- **Fabric**:  
  A safer alternative to Discord's dangerous "Manage Roles" permission.  
  Allow users to assign or remove specific roles, as authorized by staff, without risking accidental or malicious deletion or editing of roles.
- **Wardrobe**:  
  Grant staff the ability to authorize users or roles to modify a role's name, color, or icon—perfect for allowing users to customize their own roles without the need for the "Manage Roles" permission.

### 🌟 Spotlight
Highlight and rotate roles automatically!  
Staff can configure a "spotlight" role that, at custom intervals, randomly assigns a featured role to users—great for recognition or rotating responsibilities.

### 🪡 Needle
Thread creation, with user-driven control and ease of access.  
Staff can set up rules so that qualifying messages are marked (optionally with an auto-reaction "needle" emoji), indicating that any user can create a thread by reacting or using the context menu command—even if they don't have the "Create Threads" permission. This streamlines Q&A, support, or topic discussions while keeping thread creation in users' hands without spamming of unnecessary threads.

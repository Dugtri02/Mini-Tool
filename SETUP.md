# üöÄ Mini-Tool Personal/Contributor Set-up Guide

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Python Version Notice:**  
> This bot is developed and tested with **Python 3.11.x** (most development on 3.11.4).  
> **Python 3.12.x, 3.13.x, or higher are NOT supported and will likely not work.**  
> Please use Python 3.11.x for best compatibility.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Folder Structure

> **Important:**  
> Make sure all files are in the **top-most folder** in your IDE/workspace!  
> Example:
>
> ```
> Mini-Tool/
> ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
> ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
> ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
> ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cogs/
> ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ card.py
> ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compass.py
> ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...etc
> ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SETUP.md
> ```
>
> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you downloaded the bot as a ZIP from GitHub, **move all files out of any nested folders** (like `Mini-Tool-main/`) so `main.py` and the `cogs` folder are directly accessible.
>
> üí° **You are free to add or remove any available cogs from the `cogs/` folder.**  
> The bot will automatically load all `.py` files in `cogs/` on startup, so you can customize which features are enabled.
